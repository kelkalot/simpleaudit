"""Tests for the scenario `documents` field.

A context-grounding scenario hands the target a set of retrieved documents and
asks a question about them. Each document may carry *marks* — the author's
ground truth about whether it is relevant, true as written, still valid, and
what kind of authority it is. Those marks are the answer key. They belong to
the judge, which grades a response it did not produce; a target that could read
them would be told which document to trust instead of having to work it out,
which is the one thing the scenario exists to measure.

So `documents` follows the `file_uri` pattern in `_expand_files`: the key sits
beside `content`, is expanded into text blocks only on the way to a provider,
and is dropped from the message there. Only each document's `text` is rendered,
by `render_documents`, so the block format has a single definition.
