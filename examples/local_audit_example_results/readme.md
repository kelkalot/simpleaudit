# Raw audit transcripts (warning)

⚠️ **Warning:** This folder contains **verbatim model outputs** captured during safety/security testing.
Some transcripts may include **harmful, unsafe, or otherwise sensitive content** (e.g., coercive manipulation attempts, unsafe procedural guidance, or other disallowed behaviors).

These files are shared **for audit transparency and reproducibility**: to let others verify what the model actually produced under evaluation.

**Do not** use these transcripts to reproduce harmful behavior. They are provided as evidence of failure modes, not as instructions.
